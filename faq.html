                    <h2>What Is Get A Clue?</h2>
                    <p>Get A Clue (GAC) is an annual puzzle hunt hosted every spring in Atlanta. It is a city-wide, full-day hunt where teams will travel to various locations in the metropolitan Atlanta area, solving excruciating clues and completing challenges along the way. If you're completely new to the game, you've been warned!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="intro intro-lean-right notebook">
                    <h2>When is GAC?</h2>
                    <p>Get a Clue 2025 will take place on <b>April 5th, 2024</b>. Registration will open at 7:00am, and the game will start promptly at 8:00am. Although most teams should expect to finish around 8:00pm, Game Control will conclude at midnight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="intro intro-lean-right notebook">
                    <h2>Where is GAC?</h2>
                    <p>The opening Clue will be at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mstHs9ExFNDFzEMs7">Couch Building on Georgia Tech Campus</a>. The opening clue will take you across the city in search of additional clues.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-left burned">
                    <h2>How much does it cost to play?</h2>
                    <p>Registration is a flat $50 per team. A team may consist of as many players as can legally wear seatbelts in a single vehicle. Current Georgia Tech Marching Band members receive <b>a 20% discount on their registration</b>! A team with any number of active band member(s) are eligible for this discount.</p>

                    <h2>What if I'm lonely and don't have friends to play with me?</h2>
                    <p>Ask around! Ask your RAT parents! Ask your co-workers! If you genuinely want to join this daunting dash but there is not a soul to join your lonesome longing, <a href="mailto:getalclueatl@gmail.com">write to Game Control</a>. We'll get you in contact with other clue-solving orphans so you can be miserable together.</p>

                    <h2>What if I rent a Caravan from a Carniverous Carnival?</h2>
                    <p>As long as it is legal to drive and there are enough seatbelts for the entire team, then by all means, please continue.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-right notebook">
                    <h2>What kind of clues should we expect?</h2>
                    <p>Expect the sharpest, pointiest, mind-twisting clues you've ever had the misfortune of encoutering. You'll need to bring logic, creativity, and quick wit. We will provide a <a href="/gac-manual.html">manual</a> with any extraneous knowledge you might need.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-left notebook">
                    <h2>The puzzles sound grim, slippery, penultimate, even!</h2>
                    <p>Penultimate, a word here which means "the second to last thing you will think about before rasing the GAC trophy", is quite appropriate. Hints will be available for every clue, Game Control operates a distress line, and you always have the option to skip a clue if you find yourself in a complete quagmire.</p>

                    <h2>How do you win?</h2>
                    <p>The first team to complete all the clues, factoring in available bonuses, wins! The winning team gains recognition in the hallowed <a href="/gac-history.html">annals of history</a>, and earns responsibility of  the  hosting the subsequent year's Get A Clue.</p>

                    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
                    <p>There is growing evidence that we are at the center of a vast conspiracy involving a secret organization. The authors of this GAC were last seen by witnesses who should not be trusted. In our spare time, we hide the traces of our actions.</p>
