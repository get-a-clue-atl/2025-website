                    <h2>What Is Get A Clue?</h2>
                    <p>Get A Clue (GAC) is an annual puzzle hunt hosted every spring in Atlanta. It is a city-wide, full-day hunt where teams will travel to various locations in the metropolitan Atlanta area, solving clues and completing challenges along the way. If you're completely new to the game, we highly recommend viewing the series of videos produced by the 2011 Game Control team to get a better idea of what's going on.</p>

                    <h2>When is GAC?</h2>
                    <p>Get a Clue 2025 will take place on April 5th, 2024. Registration will open at 7:30am, and the game will start promptly at 8:30am. Alhtough most teams should expect to finish around 8:00pm, Game Control will conclude at midnight.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-right notebook">
                    <h2>Where is GAC?</h2>
                    <p>The opening Clue will be at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mstHs9ExFNDFzEMs7">Couch Building on Georgia Tech Campus</a>. The opening clue will take you across the city in search of additional clues.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-left burned">
                    <h2>How much does it cost to play?</h2>
                    <p>Registration is a flat $50 per team. A team may consist of as many players as can legally wear seatbelts in a single vehicle. Current Georgia Tech Marching Band members receive <b>a 20% discount on their registration</b>! A team with any number of active band member(s) are elligible for this discount.</p>

                    <h2>What if I'm lonely and don't have friends to play with me?</h2>
                    <p>Ask around! Ask your RAT parents! Ask your co-workers! If you really want to do GAC but have literally nobody to do it with, email us! We'll get you in contact with other clue-solving vagrants so you can form a team and compete. Coincidentally, if you already have a team but wouldn't mind adding a new member or two, let us know in the registration form.</p>

                    <h2>What if I rent a Caravan from a Carnival?</h2>
                    <p>As long as there are enough seatbelts for the entire team, then you are good to go!</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-right notebook">
                    <h2>What kind of clues should we expect?</h2>
                    <p>Clues are traditionally puzzles of all sorts, requiring a cross-section of trivia, logic, spatial reasoning, recognition, engineering, and music skills, and perhaps even more. For examples of past clues, the Get A Clue Archives have clues and solutions from a number of past games.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="intro intro-lean-left notebook">
                    <h2>That sounds hard! What if we’re not so great at puzzles?</h2>
                    <p>That's okay! Hints will be available for every clue, and you always have the option to skip a clue if you're totally stuck or just not enjoying it.</p>

                <div class="intro intro-lean-right ">
                    <h2>How do you win? What's the prize?</h2>
                    <p>The first team to complete all the clues, plus any additional penalties, minus bonuses, wins! The winning team is charged with the honor/responsibility of hosting the subsequent year's Get A Clue (thus making the 2nd place team "The Real Winners").</p>

                    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
                    <p>There is growing evidence that we are at the center of a vast conspiracy involving a secret organization. The authors of this GAC were last seen by witnesses who should not be trusted. In our spare time, we hide the traces of our actions.</p>
