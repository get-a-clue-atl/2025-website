        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 1993: Where the @#$& is Spivey Hall?  The 1993 edition of the game saw a few more innovations, under the leadership of Ted Rathkopf, Melinda McNeal (later married Ted and together moved to Texas), Hans Troemel, Wendy Windsor (later married Hans and together moved to the southwest of town), and a few others. A good attempt was made at balancing the overall mileage of each route, a hub-and-spoke configuration was used to create "clusters" of clues to make said mileage calculations easier, and routes may have been randomized by the order in which teams "solved" the opening clue and raced to the solution. Clues included a tour of the Oglethorpe University campus using quotes from the</p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">various buildings, an audiotape clue using the sounds of the underground Hartsfield concourse-to-concourse trains and a locker (back then, you didn't need a ticket to go through security), a skit clue featuring electromagnets and a sword in the stone, invisible ink requiring you to heat the paper, and the infamous Spivey Hall clue. Spivey Hall was not listed in the phone book, nor was it shown on most maps at the time. It was located at Clayton State College (nowadays known as Clayton State University). "Spivey Hall? Isn't that where the Atlanta Symphony plays?" - anonymous teammate of Rich's, uttered at a BP station within one mile of the correct cluesite. </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"><strong>Opening Clue</strong>: Game Control had made arrangements with a DJ at WREK-FM to play Alexander's Ragtime Band at a very specific time, as a request for "all you Get-A-Clue people out there" in that hesitant uncertain voice so common to most college radio stations.  </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 1994: Team Rambling Root Beer Barrel Polka  This game was marred somewhat by torrential rains. It featured clues onboard a double-decker bus at Great Gatsby's antiques, at the Concord Covered Bridge west of Smyrna, marching around Underground Atlanta to Coca-Cola sheet music and looking like idiots while several high school proms were taking place nearby, and another skit clue at the home of Brian Hampton's parents based on Costner's Robin Hood movie that was popular at the time, and upon which we had based a halftime show the previous fall. </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 1995: N'Digo (Nassif!)  This was a pretty good game in which most of the teams finished at a reasonable hour. One major innovation of this game was the creation of Halftime, a place where teams could rest, eat snacks, and use the bathrooms off the clock. This innovation has disappeared in recent years, but it seemed like a pretty good idea at the time. </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"><strong>Opening Clue</strong>: Each game player was given an airline ticket, and after receiving instructions, they were escorted by two lovely stewardesses (Tammy Josephs and Joe Dennison) to their seat -- the entire 2nd floor of Couch was set up as the interior of an airplane. After being served peanuts and cokes, the plane crashed into the water, so hopefully players used their seat cushions as floatation devices, because their clues were located there. Of course, during all that time, Game Control was busy attaching clue envelopes behind the license plates of all of their cars.  </p>
