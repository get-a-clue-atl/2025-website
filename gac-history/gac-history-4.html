        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2002: Dead Men Tell No Tales  The first game after 9/11 was a well-run affair, all told. Many teams finished before midnight. After recent nearly-all-night experiences, most teams were shocked to learn that they weren't even in the top five that year. The game contained a strong pirate theme, with many clues beginning with the phrase "Arr, maytees. Your next clue can be found at..." which was very useful in decoding efforts. Memorable clues included the Morse-code CD, putting the lime in the coconut, orienteering around the SAC soccer fields, the Westfork clue, and collecting a large number of transparencies that formed a treasure map when fully assembled. The soundtrack included</p>

Tampering with clue packets prevented this game from achieving absolute perfection. At the Popeye's Chicken on Piedmont, a team raced out of its van and placed a sticker for Laughing Skull beer on the packet after retrieving their clue. Customers of the Popeye's witnessed this activity, saw the sticker, and called 911. Popeye's management also had failed to notify its employees of the game that day, compounding the problem. Additionally, a clue at Sweetwater Park attracted police attention when a team stapled a pornographic picture to the envelope with the caption "Arrrr, booty". This wouldn't have</p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"><strong>Opening Clue</strong>: Game Control led teams from registration at the Student Success Center to the campanile (where the sea had magically dried up) to the library fountain. Team representatives sailed raingutter regatta ships (similar to pinewood derby cars) to the center of the fountain by blowing air into the sails, then grabbed a coin from the bottom to determine the team number. The process was accelerated somewhat when Jon Clark belly-flopped into the fountain, creating a tsunami that tossed his ship (and several others) to the center. There be reasons that a change of clothing is frequently recommended by Game Control, ye scurvy dog.  </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2003: Can You Tell Me How To Get To Sesame Street?  The 2003 game was heavily influenced by the Childrens Television Workshop. Each envelope was sponsored by a specific letter-number combination, rather than two pairs of Greek letters, in order to spell out a message at the end of the game. The manual, known as ELMO (Essential Learning Materials for Operation), only contained information essential to the solution of its more difficult puzzles. Six CDs were provided throughout the game: two in the kit with Sesame Street songs (one from the series, one parody), two containing S.O.S. music used for a crossword puzzle, one smiley-faced disc with more music used for another clue (It's Peanut</p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"><strong>Opening Clue</strong>: At the rehearsal hall, teams were given a long lecture on various types of numbers, including whole, integer, rational, irrational, prime, etc. Teams were then led to Burger Bowl, where a large number of souvenir frisbees with the GAC 2003 logo were launched at them. Teams had to bring a frisbee with a prime number back to the Couch rehearsal hall to receive their kit and begin the game - the prime number designated the team's route.  </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2004: Literally, GIT A Clue  The 2004 game included a few more innovations, including a game within the game in which teams had to determine who killed Mr. Boddy, with which weapon, and in which room. The soundtrack consisted of four genre-based CDs in the kit, titled "For Those About To Rock", "The Sing Alongs", "Trucks 'n' Beer", and "Driving with Dave." The game itself had some very good clues, but due to the sheer number of them all, the winning team finished after 19 hours around 5 AM the next day, and less than a third finished at all. The game would have featured the first website with the domain name of getaclue, but all combinations had already been reserved. Therefore, the</p>

Scenes from the movie Clue were playing on the screen. At the end, Dan Geist came out, described how the game works, and then the deliverer of a singing telegram was "shot" by the maid (Jennifer Geist)... seconds later, the sound effect played. When the victim fell, a large number of envelopes were scattered around the corpse.  </p>
