        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 1989: It started as a Pledge Project  Get-A-Clue had its humble beginnings in Spring 1989 as a brainchild of trombone player and genuine pain-in-Bucky's-side, Jim Tobin. After watching the Disney cult classic Midnight Madness, he thought, "Hey...wouldn't it be cool if we ran a game like that for the band?" At the time, he was pledging Kappa Kappa Psi, and so he brought this idea to Pledge Trainer Brian Hollahan. Brian liked this idea, and so it became the project of that pledge class, the Clueless Officer's Club. Jim later de-pledged, but stayed on to lead the Clueless Officers in the running of that game, called Get A Clue Road Adventure. That first game was well received, although</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-b">
        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">there were a few bugs that were worked out in later years. For one thing, Jim considered trespassing to be all part of the game... there were numerous run-ins with security guards, Atlanta's Finest, and other unsavory folk. And thus, the precedent was set. Also in the beginning, routes were assigned for each team before the game was begun. Also, the game started at dusk on Saturday. Despite numerous flaws, much fun was had by most. As one person put it, "Hey, we just spent 10 hours in a car driving around and looking for clues, with only a donut break. Can you imagine how productive we would be if we actually worked like this?" Although only a few teams actually completed all of the clues</p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"><strong>Opening Clue</strong>: Before the game began, you had to leave your car keys with Game Control, and then go into the Band Lounge for instruction. Then at the start of the game, you were escorted to the big pile of car keys, with the instruction, "Your first clue is somewhere in your car". The clue envelope was located tucked into the driver's sun visor. </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 1990-1991: After a Hiatus, Get A Clue is Reborn  Despite all of the fun everybody had, there was no game the next year. Get A Clue might have ended, but for the efforts of Ben Cowan. Ben refused to let the game die, so he took it upon himself to bring the game back to life. To get everybody excited again, he ran a Get-A-Clue Lite in Fall 1990 during Band Camp. GAC Lite was an all campus-based game with easy clues to get RATs familiar with the campus and how the game worked. Again, much fun was had by all, and everybody was prepared for Ben's Get Another Clue in Spring of 1991. Get Another Clue featured several new additions to the game, including the use of Greek letters to refer to the</p>
    </div>
    

    <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-b">
        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">clue sites, and the use of permission from shop keepers. Ben also introduced for the first time the concept of Help Clues. Each clue had one help clue that gave some assistance on how to solve the clue or to tell the team where the clue was located. The time value of the help clue was determined after the game, since Game Control was not really sure how many teams were going to have trouble with any of the clues. Again, routes were pre-assigned, and half of the challenge was finding a working pay-phone after each clue site to call in to Game Control. This game came down to a photo finish, with the first two teams finishing within 5 minutes of each other. Since there was confusion as to the</p>

    <div class="notebook-paper notebook-paper-a">
        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">values of the help clues, the two teams agreed that the final outcome would officially be declared a tie. Moreover, they agreed to a New Rule: The penalty for "winning" the game was that the team had to be Game Control the following year, so that the game would continue thereafter. </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 1992: It's a Bad Idea to have Get A Clue the night before a Concert Performance  And so, we move on to Spring 1992. This game, Get Yet Another Clue, was run by Fireball and contained several of the concepts started with the first two GAC's, including color-coded envelopes for each of the teams, Greek letters to represent the clue sites, and a bag of quarters given to each of the teams to use in the pay phones. The game ran well except for one slight flaw -- routes were unequal for each of the teams. Again, as was the custom, routes were predetermined by Game Control for each of the teams -- at each cluesite, you looked for your team's colored envelopes. Although there was a greater than</p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text">100 mile difference between the 1st and 2nd place teams, the first team was declared the winner, and was sentenced to put on the game the next year. The last team to finish called in its last clue at 7:32 in the morning, more than 15 hours after the game started...and later that afternoon the band had a Masterworks Concert at the brand-new Ferst Center. Needless to say, some people were woken up jussssst in time for the performance. Memorable clues included a periodic table code that led to Fernbank Science Center, following the leader at Georgia State North Metro Campus, the three billy goats gruff on Azalea Drive in Roswell, and of course, Charon, a rowboat, and Lake Allatoona. </p>
