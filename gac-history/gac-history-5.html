        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2005: GIT A Clue 2005  The 2005 game had a strong money and business theme. This can mostly be attributed to (or blamed on) the presence of four MBA students on the previous year's winning team. Being the 16th year (a nice round binary number) since the original Get A Clue Road Adventure, this game paid some small tributes to Get A Clue games of yore, without copying past puzzles. Soundtrack discs bore the titles "Compensation and Benefits Package", "Mileage Reimbursement", "Expense Account", "Executive Washroom", and "Company Historian". </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"><strong>Opening Clue</strong>: "In order to ensure fairness to our bidders, the nature of the ferst clue will not be revealed until the opening of the bid packages on April 9th." In other words, to quote Fireball in the 2001 manual, "Wouldn't you like to know?" This led to a multiple-choice test on Tech History within the manual itself. After answering all the questions correctly (thank God for wireless internet), teams were led to the smokestack in Atlantic Station where the first sealed clues were handed out.  </p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2006: Get-A-Clue: New World Order  The takeover of the Get-A-Clue franchise by Illuminated Enterprises, Inc. caused many a tremble throughout the GAC universe. The team had placed 4th and 2nd in previous games and finally took the checkered flag in 2005. Luckily, IEI won the right to run the last game before it is old enough to graduate from high school. A middle-aged team (not too old, not too young), IEI looks forward to the challenge of living up to games past and setting a new standard for future games. Soundtracks for this year's game include our strange take on radio shows broadcast throughout the day on WGAC, Get-A-Clue Radio. We still don't know what a fnord is. </p>
