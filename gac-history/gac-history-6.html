The theme had always been Indy, but for some reason many people were convinced it was Stargate. We found this amusing and went with it for a while, thus explaining the motivation for the teaser trailer. </p>

Mass manufacturing 40 cryptexes (cryptexi?) was an interesting endeavour, and there were a few people that cracked them before they were supposed to. Fortunately that had been taken into consideration, and the clue piece inside was useless until teams got to the appropriate clue packet. Also of note, the team built a makeshift "mausoleum", complete with about 170 "urns" with various gods' and mortals' names on them, where teams were required to either transcribe the names manually or stand in the area while determining which names were gods and which were mortal, the odd ones out spelling out</p>

The unfortunately named Team Apathy accidentally blundered across the finish line, squeaking by two other teams by a margin of about six minutes. After noted criminal Carmen Sandiego came through Atlanta and swiped the campus's prized icon, TECH Tower, dozens of eager ACME gumshoes/GAC players showed up at Couch to track down the thief. After a full-day trek through the mean streets of metro Atlanta, the most resourceful detectives managed to apprehend the V.I.L.E. ringleader at a house in Home Park. </p>
