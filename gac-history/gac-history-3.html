        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2000: A Briefcase Full of Clues  The 2000 game included the advent of the OHDaMN, a general reference manual for Get A Clue. Cryptography was a huge part of this game, and if not for the manual, most teams could not have finished. This was also arguably the first game in which a strong theme was established. A mix CD was distributed to all teams with part of a clue embedded inside it. A fair number of cluesites were used in earlier games, apparently unbeknownst to Game Control, but the puzzles to get to those sites were very good and innovative. The bead clue was truly amazing but required large numbers of people (or a laptop) in order to finish quickly. Also, this game included the</p>

        <p class="notebook-paper-body-text"> 2001: You Don't Know GAC  The 2001 game included a few more innovations, including a SETI T-shirt that was critical to the solution of a clue, mixing various soundbytes together to create CD tracks, recording their own parody of the Sunscreen commencement speech, and more. Also, this may have been the first year for the call-in help clue. If a cluesite was vandalized, clues could be replaced by driving to the nearest Kinko's for a fax. Clues were thoroughly tested on a variety of terrestrial species before being unleashed upon the world. This was probably the first game that stood absolutely no chance of making money, but Game Control probably considered it to be an alumni and friends</p>

Clues included the aforementioned SETI, a banner mounted on the side of a building that was only visible from the North MARTA line, washing a fire truck, and placement weaving.

Four members of each team hopped on one long pair of skis steered by ropes, which the teammates held onto. Teams raced across the grounds in front of what was then the Management cluster. The order of finish determined the team's routes.  </p>
