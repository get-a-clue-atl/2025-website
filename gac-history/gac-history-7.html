Good news is that they had found a path to salvation and handed the teams a minimalist survival guide (l3 pages) and a box of twinkles. This was the first year game control introduced QR codes that acted as check-in, links for help clues, and checking clue solutions. The game ran so smoothly that game control was actually calling teams seconds after they noticed teams were having troubles figuring clues out (we literally only had 10 actually phone calls from people calling us). Another thing that Game Control pioneered was a hard stop time… the end</p>

Teams slowly worked through puzzles to reassemble fragments of a hellacious night out on the town as found in the movie "The Hangover." This game theme also included many references to Game Control's pet dogs. Memorable clues include running around Atlantic Station, IKEA furniture shopping, finding the teams' faces photoshopped in the Little Chapel of Vegas, and playing Duck Tales. This year continued the use of QR codes for checking in at the clue location and received their next clue through email. </p>
